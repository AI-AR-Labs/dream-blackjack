Implement the feature to make all tests pass. Follow these steps:

1. Run npm test to see which tests are failing
2. Implement the minimal code needed to make tests pass
3. Run tests again to verify
4. Repeat until all tests pass
5. Ensure code follows project conventions in CLAUDE.md
6. Do not modify the tests unless they have errors

Keep running tests and fixing issues until all tests pass.
