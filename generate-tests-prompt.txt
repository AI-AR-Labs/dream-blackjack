Read the acceptance criteria from acceptance-criteria.txt and generate comprehensive tests for each criterion.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Create a new test file in the tests/ directory
2. Each acceptance criterion should have at least one test
3. Tests should fail initially (since no implementation exists yet)
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase

The tests should be thorough and cover edge cases.
