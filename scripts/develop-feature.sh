Read the acceptance criteria from acceptance-criteria.txt and generate comprehensive tests for each criterion.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Create a new test file in the tests/ directory
2. Each acceptance criterion should have at least one test
3. Tests should fail initially (since no implementation exists yet)
4. Use descriptive test names
5. Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase

The tests should be thorough and cover edge cases.

# Implement feature
echo "ðŸ’» Implementing feature to make tests pass..."
cat > implement-feature-prompt.txt << 'EOF'
Implement the feature to make all tests pass. Follow these steps:

1. Run npm test to see which tests are failing
2. Implement the minimal code needed to make tests pass
3. Run tests again to verify
4. Repeat until all tests pass
5. Ensure code follows project conventions in CLAUDE.md
6. Do not modify the tests unless they have errors

Keep running tests and fixing issues until all tests pass.
